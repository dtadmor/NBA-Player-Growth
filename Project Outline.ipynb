    "### 1. Predict how NBA players will do in a given year based on past data\n",
    "- Output: performance (points per possession) and rates for different situations or actions\n",
    "    - Option 1: predict based on touches (post, front court, and elbow)\n",
    "    - Option 2: predict based on action (drive, pull-up shot, and catch and shoot)\n",
    "- Input: passed years performance on a wider range of stats, injuries?, and age/experience\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Convert the predictions into a wins estimate\n",
    "- Output: wins per minute\n",
    "- Input: output from the predictive model\n",

    "# Plan\n",
    "### 1. Get lots of situational data from NBA.com\n",
    "*DONE*\n",
    "### 2. Understand the data better\n",
    "- Make sure I understand all stats available\n",
    "    - Literally understand the stats --- DONE ---  \n",
    "    - Some EDA to understand some relationships and distributions better --- DONE ---\n",
    "- Look at the data to determine if Option 1, Option 2, or some other option would make most sense for the predictions\n",
    "    - *Using Option 2 since there is overlap in Option 1* --- DONE ---\n",
    "- Look at the data to determine what measures to use for \"performance\" and \"rates.\" \n",
    "    - *Using PPP for shooting and an estimate of PPP on drives using a calculated expected value from assists and turnovers*  --- DONE ---\n",
    "- Determine if you are missing necessary data --- ON GOING ---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Prepare a master dataframe\n",
    "- Merge the data --- DONE ---\n",
    "- Determine what players to remove from the model based on playing time (lack of data) --- DONE ---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Create a basic model to convert points per possession into wins\n",
    "- Complete this with PPP for whichever option was chosen (or maybe PPP times rate)\n",
    "- All PPPs should be about equal or there are some underlying patterns that might need to be explored better\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. EDA with a focus on defensive stats\n",
    "- Try to determine what defensive (including rebounding) stats we might need to better be able to determine wins\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. EDA with a focus on finding predictive stats\n",
    "- Look for what offensive stats might best predict offensive output\n",
    "- Look for what defense/hustle/rebounding stats might best predict defensive output\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Create models predicting future performance based on past performance (as outlined in goals)\n",
    "- Most likely it will be a slightly different model (type, hyperparameters, and input data) for each predicted stat\n",
    "- Determine what important inferences can be made from the data\n",
    "- Determine what important predictions can be made from the data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Create a model to determine wins from stats\n",
    "- Make sure to only use the output stats from the other models\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Create a presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assumptions\n",
    "### - Predictive stats\n",
    "    - Points per possession (or another measure I use) is a reasonable estimate of the value of the possession\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Determining wins\n",
    "    - Player stats are against equal opponents (although some players play more against bench players and some play more against starters)\n",
    "    - Player stats are not just random (for example: free throw percentage against would have nothing to do with a player's defensive skill, but would be predictive of their defensive \"output\")\n",
    "    - Player stats are equally valuable on different teams and lineups\n",
    "    - Players stats are not a product of the teammates and lineups\n",
    "    - Player stats are demonstrative of their non-garbage time performance\n",
    "    - TL;DR if a stat is equivalent for two players, they are performing equally well in that category\n",
    "    \n",
    "### - Data itself\n",
    "    - NBA.com has accurately determined all of these plays and nothing is missing"
